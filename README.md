# Sublime Merge for VSCode

Sublime Merge integration for Visual Studio Code

## Features

This extension enables the following commands, available from the
command palette when in a workspace with a Git repository:

- `Open repository in Sublime Merge`: Opens the current workspace in Sublime Merge
- `Blame in Sublime Merge`: Opens the **Blame** view in Sublime Merge
- `File history in Sublime Merge`: Shows the **history** (log) of the current file in Sublime Merge
- `Line history in Sublime Merge`: Shows the history of the **selected line(s)** in Sublime Merge
- `Show my commits in Sublime Merge`: Show commits from the **current Git user** in Sublime Merge

Contextual menu items for the editor are also provided and dependent on whether a selection is present or not.

## Requirements

Make sure that `git` and the `smerge` commands are available within your PATH.

### Setting up the Sublime Merge command line tool

See: https://www.sublimemerge.com/docs/command_line

## Sublime Merge setup (optional)

The following example (by [Rub√©n Robles](https://twitter.com/D8vjork/status/1158303356382842881)) shows how it's possible to configure Sublime Merge to use Visual Studio Code as the default editor for opening files:

```json
{
	"editor_path": "/usr/local/bin/code",
	"editor_argument_format": "--goto ${file}:${line}:${col}"
}
```
These can be manually added to the Sublime Merge `Preferences.sublime-settings` file.

## Known Issues / TODO

- The extension hasn't been tested on Windows yet
- Tests are not present

This is my first VSCode extension, therefore any constructive feedback is very welcome.

## Release Notes

See the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

## Special Thanks

I've been able to start working on this extension thanks to the personal development time kindly allowed
by my current employer, [Altmetric](https://www.altmetric.com/jobs/).
